I have been noticing that my email posts on one of the Google Groups I am subscribed to do not get replies from other members anymore. I was starting to get upset and thought my popularity has dropped and people are totally skipping my emails! I asked <a href="http://blog.gammal.org/">Mahmoud </a>what was the last email he got from me and he told me it was several days ago! I logged in to the group website and found that my recent posts do NOT get delivered at all, without a single notice from Google!<br /><span class="fullpost"><br />After several tests I came to the following:<br />When your subscription in Google Groups is on email A, you have to really send from this email account A. If you use an email account B with an alternate account A (that appears in the From field), this will not work (as of May 29th and at least for me!)<br />You will not even get a delivery error from Google in this case because they think you are forging this email.<br /><br />However, if you send from a totally different account C (and don't try to modify the sender), you will get a delivery error.<br /><br />Moreover, if you send from account A USING ANY ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNT B, C, D, ... The message will be delivered!<br /><br /><b>Bottom line, now they only look for the real sender, and if an alternative account is used, they don't reply back with any error.</b><br /></span>
