Do I love Egypt? I have to love my country. So why they imprisoned me for a whole year plus 45 days as a soldier? I wish I have practiced something useful when fighting comes. Instead I practiced writing letters, cleaning bathrooms and even electing good bean and rice particles to cook.<br /><br />I still love Egypt, I have to. So why they took my driving license today? Should this solve corruption? Is this the only possible way to raise our country instead of busting rich thieves? Does everyone in his vehicle wrap his seat belt? Or it was only because I am long-bearded and my wife is wearing black?<br /><br />I still love Egypt, but 26 years are enough and Egypt is not Syria!
