Today we gathered for the farewell of <a href="http://ecen.qatar.tamu.edu/425.aspx">Dr Alouini</a> at <a href="http://www.qatar.tamu.edu/">TAMUQ</a>. It has only been one week since I am here at TAMUQ, but Dr Alouini did have an effect on my career! Last October when I came here for an interview, Dr Slim (and <a href="http://ecen.qatar.tamu.edu/838.aspx">Dr Shehab Ahmed</a>) urged me to finish my Masters so that they can apply for my VISA.<br /><br />After I came back to Egypt, I took an unpaid vacation from my work at <a href="http://www.espace.com.eg/">eSpace</a> and started the campus of studying! Thanks to Allah, I got the Masters certificate last February. I was always remembering Dr Alouini's words about pushing my career onwards and finishing the Masters as quickly as possible.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Fxxo5JtY8z8/Sg_3TFzOs7I/AAAAAAAAACM/IkrP-4C-9qU/s1600-h/17052009147.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Fxxo5JtY8z8/Sg_3TFzOs7I/AAAAAAAAACM/IkrP-4C-9qU/s400/17052009147.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5336755990803952562" border="0" /></a><br /><br />From right: Hossam Hammady (me), <a href="http://people.qatar.tamu.edu/wessam-mesbah/">Dr Wessam Mesbah</a>, Dr Alouini, Dr Ahmed Masoud, Majid Farouqi.<br /><br />So although we didn't meet much, but thanks Dr. Alouini for pushing me onwards.<br /><br /><span class="fullpost"></span>
