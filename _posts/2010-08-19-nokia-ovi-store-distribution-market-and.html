Today I was reading some technical news and came across <a href="http://blogs.forum.nokia.com/blog/nokia-developer-news/2010/08/16/new-forum-nokia-page-shares-ovi-store-statistics">an article</a> from the Forum Nokia Blog. The article highlights the achievements and new features of the <a href="http://store.ovi.com/">Ovi Store</a>. What drew my attention in this page is the distribution market map of the store. It basically tells which countries have paid apps, which have free only apps, which are totally blocked!<div><br /><span class="fullpost"><br /><br /><img src="http://www.forum.nokia.com/pics/distribute-ovi-store-global-map.jpg" style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;width: 400px; height: 267px;" border="0" alt="" /><br />As you can see from the map, these are the axis-of-evil countries that are blocked from the Ovi Store:</span></div><div><ol><li>Iran</li><li>Syria</li><li>Sudan</li><li>Cuba</li><li>North Korea</li><li>Cote d'Ivoire</li><li>Congo</li><li>Zimbabwe</li><li><i>Did my eyes miss something?</i></li></ol></div><div><span class="fullpost">This reminds me of the <a href="http://arabcrunch.com/2010/01/following-clintons-internet-freedom-speech-us-based-sourceforge-blocked-syria-sudan-iran-korea-cuba-is-open-source-still-really-open.html">ban of some of these countries</a> from the SourceForge website post <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm">Clinton's Internet Freedom Speech</a>. At least Nokia should make this block list under the control of the app publishers, exactly like <a href="http://news.northxsouth.com/2010/03/03/sourceforge-and-the-us-laws/">what SourceForge did</a>.</span></div><div><span class="fullpost"><br /></span></div><div><span class="fullpost">I don't like the political influence on the technical world. It does not align with the human rights of the people of these countries.</span></div><div><span class="fullpost"><br /></span></div><div><span class="fullpost">You too Nokia?</span></div><div><div><br /></div></div>
