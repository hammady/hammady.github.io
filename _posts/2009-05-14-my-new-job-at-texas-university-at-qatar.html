It has been so long since I posted anything here. I am always lazy writing blogs :( Today I thought I should write something. From now on, my blogs should be short so that I don't get lazy writing them!<br /><br />So, I am writing this to let you know that I have joined <a href="http://www.qatar.tamu.edu">Texas A&M University at Qatar</a> as a Teaching Associate. The hiring process took too long since I had to finish my Masters first before I apply for the VISA. Thanks Allah, I finished my Masters last February, but this is another story, I will write about it soon insha2Allah :)<br /><br />I am now in Doha with my little family, my wife and my little 1-year-old kid, Abdullah. My job here includes both teaching tasks and support in IT-related issues for the faculty.<br /><br />A lot of paper work to do here to finish my residency permit and settle in my new house. I didn't take any task yet, just all about orientation and settlement. I hope work would be fun here as I have always enjoyed my job :)<br /><br /><span class="fullpost"></span>
